# HCMMCNVs

HCMMCNVs is a browser-based software for detecting copy number variants (CNVs) using whole exome sequencing (WES) technology 

## How to start the software

#### Requirement
* R >= 4.0.1
* Shiny >= 1.2.0

* Open R 
```R
install.packages('shiny')
library(shiny)
shiny::runGitHub("HCMM_CNVs","lunching", destdir = <your app directory>)
```
Setting the directory of downloaded HCMMCNVs using `destdir` (Directory to store the downloaded application files) is suggested because the stored segmentation mean for visualization modeule will be automatically saved under the app directory.
